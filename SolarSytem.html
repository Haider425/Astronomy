                        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
                        It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence 
                        by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly 
                        as light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important 
                        source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, 
                        or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. 
                        It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 
                        Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); 
                        the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier 
                        elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

                        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. 
                        Its orbit around the Sun takes only 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets 
                        in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of 
                        the gods.

                        and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus 
                        can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

                        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
                        About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% 
                        is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by 
                        lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's 
                        polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates 
                        that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with 
                        a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective 
                        mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
                        being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and 
                        is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide 
                        prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the 
                        astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin 
                        atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the 
                        valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant 
                        with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets 
                        in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in 
                        the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is 
                        named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its 
                        reflected light to cast visible shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in 
                        the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

                        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
                        It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth 
                        the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. 
                        Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents 
                        the god's sickle.

                        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, 
                        Uranus according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus 
                        (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest 
                        planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk 
                        chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this 
                        reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the 
                        gas giants. Uranus' atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of 
                        hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with 
                        traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a 
                        minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with 
                        water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior 
                        of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.

                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the 
                        fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
                        Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is 
                        denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational 
                        compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance 
                        of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the 
                        astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
